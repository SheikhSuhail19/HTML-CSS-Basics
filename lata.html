            Lata Mangeshkar(born as Hema Mangeshkar; 28 September 1929 â€“ 6 February 2022) was an Indian playback singer
            and occasional music composer. She is widely considered to have been one of the greatest and most
            influential singers in India. Her contribution to the Indian music industry in a career spanning seven
            decades gained her honorific titles such as the "Queen of Melody", "Nightingale of India", and "Voice of the
            Millennium".
            <br>
            Lata Mangeshkar recorded songs in over thirty-six Indian languages and a few foreign languages, though
            primarily in Hindi, Bengali, Marathi. She also sang in English, Russian, Dutch, and even Swahili. She
            received several accolades and honors throughout her career. In 1989 the Dadasaheb Phalke Award was bestowed
            on her by the Government of India. In 2001, in recognition of her contributions to the nation, she was
            awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour; she is only the second female singer, after M. S.
            Subbulakshmi, to receive this honour. France conferred on her its highest civilian award, Officer of the
            National Order of the Legion of Honour, in 2007.
            <br>
            She was the recipient of three National Film Awards, 15 Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four
            Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards, two Filmfare Special Awards, the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award
            and many more. In 1974, she was one of the first Indian playback singers to ever perform at Royal Albert
            Hall in London, UK. Her last recorded song was "Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti ki" released on 30 March 2019 as a
            tribute to the Indian army and Nation.
            <br>
            At one point, she appeared in the Guinness World Records which listed her as the most recorded artist in
            history between 1948 and 1987.
